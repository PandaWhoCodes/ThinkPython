"""The brilliant mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan found an infinite series
that can be used to generate a numerical approximation of pi:
Write a function called estimate_pi that uses this formula to compute and
return an estimate of pi. It should use a while loop to compute terms of
the summation until the last term is smaller than 1e-15 (which is Python
notation for 10^âˆ’15 ). You can check the result by comparing it to math.pi
